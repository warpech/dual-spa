## Dual SPA (single page application) POC (proof of concept)

This demo shows a proof of concept of a web application that:

- (done) loads partial content while changing the URL using HTML5 History API
- (not done) binds partial content to JSON data source
- (not done) uses compound component `<btn-group>` that consists of `<btn>` elements

The POC is implemented in two flavors:

- AngularJS
- W3C Web Components
